```{r}
library(dplyr)
mtcars1 <- mtcars   %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  select(cyl , mpg, disp)

mtcars1
```


# CASE 1: apply 1 function to 1 variable
```{r}

# without group
mtcars1 %>% 
  summarise (mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
## Source: local data frame [1 x 1]
## 
##   mean_mpg
##      (dbl)
## 1 20.09062

str(mtcars1)

# with  group
mtcars1 %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise (mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
## Source: local data frame [3 x 2]
## 
##     cyl mean_mpg
##   (dbl)    (dbl)
## 1     4 26.66364
## 2     6 19.74286

#We could use function summarise_each() as well but, its usage results in a loss of clarity.

# without group
mtcars1 %>% 
  summarise_each (funs(mean) , mean_mpg = mpg)
## Source: local data frame [1 x 1]
## 
##   mean_mpg
##      (dbl)
## 1 20.09062
# with  group
mtcars1 %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise_each (funs(mean) , mean_mpg = mpg)
## Source: local data frame [3 x 2]
## 
##     cyl mean_mpg
##   (dbl)    (dbl)
## 1     4 26.66364
## 2     6 19.74286
## 3     8 15.10000

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
